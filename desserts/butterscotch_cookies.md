Post by [Cody Emrick](https://github.com/ce-kazvu)

## Ingredients

- 1 stick butter
- 2 cups brown sugar
- 2 eggs
- ½ tsp vanilla
- ½ tbsp cream of tartar
- ½ tbsp baking soda
- 2 ¾ cups flour

## Instructions

1. Ensure butter is pliant and add to bowl. Add sugar and cream it.
2. Add eggs and continue mixing.
3. Continue mixing and add vanilla, cream of tartar, and baking soda.
4. Add flour in small batches and allow to incorporate.
5. Add dough to loaf pan or wrap in cling wrap and roll into log. Place in fridge overnight.
6. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350ºF. Cut log into ¼ inch or ½ inch segments and lay on parchment paper.
7. Bake for 10-11 minutes or until edges begin to brown and crisp. Allow to cook for a couple minutes before serving.

## Notes

- Highly recommend using a stand mixer to continually incorporate the dough.
- Original recipe below had issues with the dough being too dry, but I had no issues.
- If butter is not room temperature, you can whack it with a rolling pin on each side to make it flexible.
