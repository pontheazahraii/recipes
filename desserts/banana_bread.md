Yields 1 loaf

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients

- 1¾ cups + 1 tbsp (215g) all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp (4g) baking soda 
- 1 tsp (5g) fine salt 
- ½ tsp (1g) ground cinnamon
  
- ½ cup (100g) white sugar
- ½ cuo (100g) brown sugar, light or dark
- 2 large eggs
- 4 tbsp (60g) buttermilk (or yogurt) 
- 1 tsp vanilla bean paste or extract
- ½ cup extra virgin olive oil
- 4 vevy very ripe bananas, mashed 

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan or line it with parchment paper, leaving a bit of overhang for easy removal.
2. If the bananas aren’t ripe, bake them 15–17 minutes. Remove, let cool slightly, then mash.
3. Whisk the dry ingredients together in a small bowl: flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.
4. In a large bowl, whisk sugars and egg until smooth. Stir in buttermilk, vanilla, mashed bananas, and olive oil. 
5. Gently fold the dry mixture into the wet until just combined (don’t overmix). Fold in any mix-ins at this stage aswell. 
6. Pour the batter into the pan. Bake 55–65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
7. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Enjoy!

## Notes

- You can add in mix-ins such as walnuts, pecans, chocolate chips, nutella, peanut butter, or anything else you would like. 
- Peel a banana and then cut it down the middle, the long way. Place on the top of the banana bread as decoration.
