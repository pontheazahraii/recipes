Post by [Ponthea Zahraii](https://github.com/pontheazahraii)
## Ingredients 

* ¾ cup salted butter   
* 1 cup raw sugar  
* 2 eggs  
* 1 tbsp vanilla extract   
* 1 cup all-purpose flour   
* ¾ cup rolled oats   
* ¾ tsp baking soda   
* ¾ tsp kosher salt  
* ½ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips   
* ½ cup caramel chips   
* ½ cup walnuts

## Instructions 

1. Brown the butter over medium heat, stirring constantly until the butter begins to foam and turns a golden brown, emitting a nutty aroma. Make sure to only brown the butter slightly. Take butter off the heat and allow it to cool.   
2. In a small mixing bowl, combine the cooled brown butter and raw sugar and beat until mixed together. Add in the eggs and vanilla extract and continue mixing.   
3. In a separate large bowl, mix together the flour, oats, salt, and baking soda. Slowly add in the wet ingredients and mix. Once combined add in the chocolate, caramel, and walnuts. Mix until fully incorporated making sure not to overmix.   
4. Refrigerate the cookie dough for at least 30 minutes or overnight.   
5. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350°F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Round the dough into ping pong sized balls and place them 2 inches apart on the sheet. Bake for 11-13 minutes, or until only the edges are golden brown.   
6. Allow to cool down before eating\!

## Notes 

* You can roll the cookie dough into balls and put them in a freezer bag to store in the freezer for two months for the best quality. The pre-rolled balls can then be thawed and baked in the oven like in the recipe.   
* To ensure the cookies are not over baked, remove them from the oven when the edges are golden brown and the middle is soft and gooey.   
* If the butter is not cooled and added to the mixture, it will cook the eggs, to avoid that the butter must be cooled before adding.
