## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients

- 3/4 Panko bread crumbs 
- Olive oil 
- 1 egg 
- 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese 
- 3 cloves garlic 
- 1 cup tomato sauce
- 1 sprig fresh basil  

### Seasonings

- Salt 
- Pepper 
- Oregano 

### Toppings

- Fresh Basil 
- Fresh Mozzarella 

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 450Â°F. 
2. Finely dice your garlic and chiffonade the basil. Add the garlic to a saucepan on medium-low heat with olive oil and slightly brown. Add in the tomato sauce and basil and let simmer. 
3. Butterfly the chicken breast and with a meat mallet or rolling pin flatten the chicken into a uniform thickness. Season with salt and pepper. 
4. In a shallow bowl, beat the egg with a splash of water. In a seperate shollow bowl add the panko bread crumbs, oregano, and parmsean and mix. 
5. Put a saucepan on the stove at medium heat with olive oil and let the oil heat up. 
6. While the oil is heating, dip your chicken into the egg mixture, making sure to coat the whole breast. Then, move your coated chicken into the bread crumb mixture and coat generously. After coated, place into the hot oil. 
7. After the side facing down turn golden brown, flip the chicken and cook till the other side is golden brown. If you flip too early the bread crumb coating might fall off. 
8. Once fully cooked, place on a wire rack or paper towel to catch excess oil. 
9. Repeat step 6-8 for all pieces of chicken. 
10. The sauce should be complete now. Turn off the heat. 
11. Place the cooked chicken on a sheet pan and top with some of the sauce, leaving half of it for later. Top with fresh mozzarella slices and place in the oven until the cheese is bubbling and the inside is fully cooked, 15-20 minutes. 
12. After removing from the oven, coat the bottom of the serving dish with the remaining sauce and lay the pieces of chicken on top. Top with fresh basil leaves and enjoy :). 

## Notes 

- To make even more flavorful, try shallow frying the garnish basil in olive oil until translucent.
- Make sure you are keeping the hand you use to dip the chicken in the egg mixture seperate from the hand you use for the panko mixture.
