Submitted by [Cody Emrick](https://github.com/ce-kazvu)

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients
- 1.5 quarts Ragu Bolognese (see recipe under sauces)
- 3 cups ricotta filling (see recipe under fillings)
- 1 pack no-boil lasagna noodles
- Low-moisture mozzarella

### Spices
- Salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 F.
2. Prepare 9x13" baking dish. Add a thin layer of sauce to the bottom of the dish.
3. Add noodles. Sprinkle with salt.
4. Add layer of bolognese.
5. Add dollops of ricotta.
5. Add spread of besciemella.
6. Optionally add additional sprinkling of Parmegiano-Reggiano.
7. Repeat until the baking dish is full. About six layers.
8. Top layer should be coated with besciemella, parmesan, and any extra mozzarella.
9. Bake uncovered for 45 minutes to 1 hour until fairly dry. Remove and allow to set.

# Notes
- Instead of seasoning each layer with salt, you can instead salt your bolognese to taste and then over-salt somewhat so the noodles can absorb the extra.
- Similarly, you can allow your bolognese to be a bit soupier than intended. The uncooked noodles will absorb a lot of moisture.
