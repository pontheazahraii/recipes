## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients

* 1 medium-sized pumpkin   
* ½ lb ground beef   
* 2 oz tomato paste  
* 1 onion   
* 8 cloves garlic   
* 1 jalapeño  
* 1 can beans (kidney, black, or pinto)

### Seasonings

* Salt   
* Pepper   
* Tumeric   
* Cinnamon   
* Cumin   
* Paprika   
* Garlic Powder   
* Thyme

### Toppings

* Sour Cream   
* Shredded Mexican Blend Cheese  
* Chives  
* Trader Joe’s Elote Corn Chip Dippers (or Frito’s Scoops)

## Instructions 

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F. While the oven is preheating, cut the pumpkin into slices and lay it on a sheet pan—season it with salt, pepper, and a high-smoking point oil. Once preheated add to the oven and let roast for 45 minutes, flipping halfway through.  
2. Dice the onions, garlic, and jalapeños. To a large saucepan (or Dutch oven) on medium heat, add cooking oil and the onions, continuously stirring. Once translucent, incorporate the jalapeños and garlic. Season with turmeric, salt, pepper, garlic pepper, and paprika.   
3. Add the tomato paste and half a cup of water to the saucepan. Stir until all the onion mixture is coated.   
4. Add the onion mixture with a cup of water to a food processor and pulse until almost fully blended. You don’t want to have big chunks, but small chunks are okay. Once this has been done, put the mixture back into the saucepan and put it on the stove.   
5. Add the ground beef to the pan and break it up with a spatula, continuously mixing. Add in the rest of the seasonings (cinnamon, cumin, and thyme). Once the beef is cooked, taste and add more seasoning as desired.   
6. Add a cup of water and the can of beans and let simmer on low heat until the pumpkin is done roasting. 
7. Cut ¼ of the roasted pumpkin into small-sized chunks and add to the simmering chili. Add the rest of the pumpkin to a food processor, adding water gradually to make it into a puree.   
8. Incorporate the pumpkin puree with the chili and let simmer for 5-10 minutes.   
9. Serve with shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream, chives on top, and Trader Joe’s Elote Corn Chip Dippers on the side to scoop the chili into.
