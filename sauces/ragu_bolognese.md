## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients

- 2/3 lbs ground lamb (or 85/15 ground beef)
- 2/3 lbs ground pork
- 2/3 lbs ground veal
- 4 oz chicken livers (optional)
- 1 1/2 cups onion, diced
- 1 cup carrot, diced
- 1 cup celery, diced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 4 tbsp butter
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup fresh sage
- 28 oz can San Marzano tomatoes
- 1 1/2 cups dry wine
- 1 1/2 cups milk (preferably whole)
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 1/2 cups heavy cream

### Spices
- Salt
- Black Pepper
- Red Pepper Flake
- Basil
- Parsley
- 2 Bay Leaves
- Worstershire, Fish Sauce, or MSG

## Instructions

1. Use onion, carrot, celery, and garlic to create battuto.
2. Preheat dutch oven with butter and olive oil over high heat. Stir occasionally. Wait until butter has stopped foaming.
3. Add meats and break apart. Stire and cook until no longer raw.
4. Place meat in strainer over bowl to catch drippings.
5. Add battuto and drippings back to dutch oven. Sweat until translucent, but not browned.
6. Return meat to dutch oven.
7. Add tomatoes to dutch oven. Crush them if they are peeled and not pre-crushed.
8. Add wine, milk, stock, and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer over high heat, and then reduce to low.
9. Partially cover and simmer for 3 hours. Liquid should be below the level of the meat.
10. Remove bay leaves. Add worstershire/fish sauce/MSG and heavy cream. Simmer until fat is emulsified.
11. Season to taste with black & red pepper, salt, basil, and parsley.

## Notes

- Portioned for 1 lasagna in a 9x13" baking dish. To scale to 1 lb each of the meats, increase liquids by 1/3 cup.dd
- When adjusting portions, note that reduction time depends heavily on surface area of the dutch oven to volume of liquid.
