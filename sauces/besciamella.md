Submitted by [Cody Emrick](https://github.com/ce-kazvu)

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients
- 2 tbsp butter
- 2 tbsp flour
- 2 cloves crushes garlic, or 1/2 tsp of garlic powder
- 2 cups milk (preferably whole)
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella
- 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

### Seasonings

- Salt
- Black Pepper
- Nutmeg

## Instructions

1. Create a roux with the butter, flour, and milk.
2. Add garlic and combine.
3. Add milk in small amounts. Continue to whisk to incorporate.
4. Continue to whisk. Bring to a simmer and then reduce to heat to low.
5. Mix in cheeses in small batches, continuing to whisk and incorporate.
6. Bring back to a simmer. The texture and consistency should smooth out.
7. Remove from heat. Season to taste.

## Notes

- As this is a bechamel base with cheese added, it is technically a Mornay sauce. However, in Italian tradition, a bechamel intended for a lasagna will have some cheese (usually parmesan or mozzarella) mixed in.
- If possible, use fresh nutmeg.
