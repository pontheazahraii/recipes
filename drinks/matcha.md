# Matcha Latte

Yields 1 serving

## Ingredients

- 2g high-quality matcha powder
- 20g (about 2 tbsp) filtered water (85°C / 185°F)
- Milk of choice 

## Instructions

1. **Bloom the Whisk:** Place your bamboo matcha whisk (chasen) in a bowl of hot water for 1–5 minutes to soften and expand the tines. This helps prevent breakage and creates a frothier matcha.
2. **Heat Water:** Heat filtered water to 85°C (185°F). Avoid boiling to prevent burning the matcha.
3. **Sift Matcha:** Sift 2g of matcha powder into a small bowl to remove clumps.
4. **Add Water:** Pour 20g of hot water over the matcha powder.
5. **Whisk:** Using the chasen, whisk briskly in a zig-zag ("Z") motion until the matcha is frothy and fully dissolved.
6. **Serve:** Enjoy as is, or add steamed/frothed milk for a matcha latte.

## Notes

- Adjust water or milk to taste for a thinner or creamier drink.
- Use a traditional chawan (matcha bowl) for best results, but any small bowl works.
- For an iced version, pour over ice and add cold milk.
