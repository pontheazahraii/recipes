# Japanese Green Tea

Yields 2 servings

## Ingredients

- 2 tsp (about 4g) loose-leaf Japanese green tea
- 2 cups (480ml) filtered water

## Instructions

1. **Heat Water:** Bring water to a boil, then let it cool to about 75–80°C (167–176°F). Using water that's too hot can make the tea bitter.
2. **Add Tea:** Place 2 tsp of sencha or genmaicha leaves into a small teapot (kyusu) or heatproof teapot.
3. **Brew:** Pour the hot water over the tea leaves. Steep for 1–2 minutes (shorter for a lighter brew, longer for stronger flavor).
4. **Serve:** Pour the tea into small cups, alternating between cups to ensure even flavor. Enjoy immediately.

## Notes

- This brewing method works well for most Japanese green teas, including:
	- Sencha
	- Genmaicha (green tea with roasted brown rice)
	- Bancha (late-harvested green tea)
	- Kukicha (twig tea)
	- Hojicha (roasted green tea; use hotter water for a stronger brew)
- All are best enjoyed plain, without milk or sugar.
- For a second brew, use slightly hotter water and a shorter steeping time.
- Use a fine mesh strainer if your teapot doesn't have a built-in filter.
