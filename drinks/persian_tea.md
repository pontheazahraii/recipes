Yields 2 servings

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients

- 2 tsp loose-leaf black tea (preferably Ceylon or Persian blend)
- 2 cups (480ml) filtered water
- Optional: 1-2 cardamom pods, rose petals, or a small piece of dried lime (limoo amani)
- Sugar cubes (ghand) or rock sugar (nabat), for serving

## Instructions

1. **Boil Water:** Bring 2 cups of filtered water to a boil in a kettle.
2. **Warm the Teapot:** Pour a little boiling water into a small teapot (preferably glass or porcelain) to warm it, then discard the water.
3. **Add Tea:** Place 2 tsp of loose-leaf black tea into the teapot. Add cardamom, rose petals, or dried lime if desired.
4. **Brew:** Pour the boiling water over the tea leaves. Place the teapot over the kettle (samovar-style) or on very low heat. Let it steep gently for 10–15 minutes, allowing the color to deepen.
5. **Serve:** Pour a small amount of brewed tea into a glass or cup, then dilute with hot water to your preferred strength. Sweeten with sugar cubes or rock sugar.

## Notes

- Persian tea is traditionally served in small, clear glasses to appreciate its color.
- Adjust steeping time for a lighter or stronger brew.
- Enjoy with dried fruits, sweets, or dates for a classic Persian experience.
