Yields 4 waffles

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 4 tbsp granulated sugar 
- 4 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt 
- 2 eggs
- 1½ cups milk 
- 6 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

### Toppings

- Maple Syrup

## Instructions

1. Preheat waffle iron. Gently coat with nonstick baking spray
2. In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients. Use the back of a spoon to create a "well" in the center. 
3. Whisk the eggs into the milk until well combined. 
4. Pour wet ingredients into the well of the dry ingredients and whisk until blended. The batter will be slightly lumpy, do not overmix. 
5. Scoop the batter into the preheated waffle iron and cook until the waffles are golden brown and crisp. 
6. Serve immediately or lay on a wire cooling rack until cool. 

## Notes

- Make sure the butter is not too hot so you do not cook the eggs. 
- Freeze and reheat in the toaster to meal prep. 
- This recipe can also be used for pancakes.
