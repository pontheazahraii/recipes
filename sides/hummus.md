Yields 4 servings

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients

- 1 cup dry chickpeas
- 1 ½ tsp baking soda
- 1 cup olive oil
- 12 cloves garlic
- 6 sprigs thyme
- 1 cup tahini paste
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- Ice-cold water

### Seasonings

- Salt

## Instructions

1. Soak chickpeas with 1 tsp of baking soda overnight in enough water to allow them to double in size.
2. Drain and rinse the soaked chickpeas.
3. Bring the chickpeas and remaining ½ tsp of baking soda to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover and lower to medium heat. Cook for 30-45 minutes or until chickpeas are cooked through and easily squished between two fingers, skimming the top of the water as needed. Remove the lid, add a pinch of salt, and cook for 15 more minutes.
4. While the chickpeas are cooking, peel 12 cloves of garlic.
5. Pour olive oil in a pan and add the garlic cloves and thyme. Cook on medium-low heat for 20-25 minutes, until garlic cloves are golden brown.
6. Remove the thyme sprigs from the oil and set aside.
7. Drain the cooked chickpeas and set aside a handful to use as a garnish.
8. Combine the cooked chickpeas, tahini paste, lemon juice, and 8 confit garlic cloves in a food processor and pulse until smooth.
9. Slowly add 5-7 tbsp ice-cold water while blending until the desired consistency is reached.
10. Plate hummus on a wide platter, smoothing the surface with the back of a spoon. Press a small well in the center for the garnishes.
11. Drizzle 2 tbsp of confit garlic oil over the plated hummus. Garnish with the 4 remaining confit garlic cloves, the handful of whole cooked chickpeas, and thyme sprigs.

## Notes

- To add some spice, 1 green chili can be cooked in the confit and later used as a garnish.
