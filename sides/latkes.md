Post by [Nataniel Farzan](https://github.com/natanielf)

Yields about 36 latkes

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients

- 3 medium russet potatoes
- 1 yellow onion
- 3 eggs
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- Frying oil

### Seasonings

- 1 tsp salt
- ½ tsp black pepper
- Flaky sea salt

### Toppings

- Apple sauce
- Sour cream
- Capers
- Lox

## Instructions

1. Thoroughly wash potatoes before slicing into quarters lengthwise. Slice onion into quarters.
2. Shred potatoes and onion with a food processor using a coarse grating disc. Alternatively, slice potatoes and onions into thin shreds.
3. Place the combined potatoes and onions in a clean dish towel and wring out as much excess moisture as possible into a bowl.
4. Wait a few minutes for the starch to settle. Carefully discard the water, making sure the white starchy substance is left at the bottom of the bowl.
5. Crack the eggs into the bowl containing the potato starch and beat together.
6. Transfer the potatoes and onions to the bowl containing the starch and eggs and combine.
7. Add flour, salt, pepper, and baking powder and mix thoroughly.
8. Heat a ¼ inch layer of oil in a frying pan.
9. For each latke, place a heaping tablespoon of batter in the pan and gently flatten with the back of a spatula. Cook until the edges of the latkes turn brown and start to crisp. Flip and continue cooking until the latkes are cooked through and turn brown.
10. Transfer to a paper towel to allow the oil to drain. Promptly top each latke with a pinch of flaky sea salt. Enjoy!

## Notes

- Refrigerate the leftover batter for future use.
