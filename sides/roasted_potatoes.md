Post by Ponthea Zahraii￼

Yields 4–6 servings

Ingredients

Main Ingredients
	•	2 lbs potatoes, cut into 1–1.5 inch chunks
	•	2 tbsp olive oil
	•	½ lemon (juice + optional zest)

Seasonings
	•	2–3 cloves garlic, minced
	•	Fresh dill, chopped (2–3 tbsp + more for garnish)
	•	1–2 tsp Dijon mustard
	•	Red pepper flakes (to taste)
	•	Salt
	•	Pepper

Instructions
	1.	Cut and boil the potatoes:
Add potato chunks to salted water and boil for 8–10 minutes, just until slightly tender. Drain well.
	2.	First bake:
Spread boiled potatoes onto a baking sheet. Bake at 425°F for 15 minutes to dry and lightly crisp the surface.
	3.	Prepare the dressing:
In a bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper.
	4.	Toss with dressing:
Remove potatoes from the oven, transfer to a bowl, and toss with the lemon-Dijon mixture until fully coated.
	5.	Final bake:
Return coated potatoes to the baking sheet and roast for an additional 20–25 minutes, or until golden and crisp.
	6.	Finish:
Sprinkle generously with fresh dill before serving.

Notes
	•	Boiling first makes the centers fluffy and the outsides extra crispy.
	•	Add more red pepper flakes if you want it spicy.
	•	A little lemon zest at the end brightens the flavor.
