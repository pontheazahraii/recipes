Yields 4 servings

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients

- 12 oz green beens, trimmed
- 2 tbsp sliced almonds 
- 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 
- 1 shallot, thinly sliced 
- 1 garlic clove 
- Â½ fresh lemon, juiced

### Seasonings

- Salt 
- Pepper

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and set a large bowl of ice water nearby. Drop the green beans into the boiling water and blanch for 3-4 minutes. Drain, and immediately immerse in the ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain, and transfer to a towel to let dry. 
2. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add the almonds to the dry skillet and toast until golden brown, 2-3 minutes. Remove the almonds from the pan and set aside. 
3. Add the oil to the pan (turn down if necessary), then add the shallots and the shot and saute for 2 minutes. Add the green beans and saute, 2-4 more minutes, until the green beans are warmed through and tender. Remove the pan from the heat, add the garlic and lemon juice and toss. Season to taste with salt and pepper and transfer to a serving dish. Top with the almonds and serve.

## Notes

- You can also saute the shallots, almonds, and garlic, seasoning with salt and pepper together if you want to make this dish quicker.
